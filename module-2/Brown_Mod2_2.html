   <p class="intro">
    Hi,my name is Yolanda Brown. I am originally from South Carolina but
      right now , I live in Charlotte, NC. Actaully, I have been living in Charlotte
      now for over 22 years
   </p>

   <p>During my stages of growing in, I have come to realize that Spritual Growth
      is very important. I am attending Church when I can as I do work 2 jobs plus go to school.
      I also have learned that I like to walk for exercise and would
      enjoy visiting different places more to check out the parks.      
   </p>

   <p> 
     <span style ="color: blue;font-weight:bolder"> I dream to become a Software Engineer one day because
       I think it is fasinating writing code and watching it run. The
       first computer I ever owned was by my Mom and it was a Commadore.
       So now, here I am still in the computer field and wanting to retire in this
       profession.
